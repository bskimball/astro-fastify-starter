# *** Latest ***
I have updated to Astro v5 and React 19. Since the Astro/react integration has not yet updated their deps your NPM install will need to include the --peer-legacy-deps flag. I have removed Next ui and react-hook-form and it is using react action api for forms. 

# Astro Fastify Starter

This is an example repo of having astro and fastify in the same app.
This example is based on the fastify example in the
[node adapter](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/node/#middleware) section.
The main difference is this uses typescript. It also has an example of using the
[trpc fastify adapter](https://trpc.io/docs/server/adapters/fastify), so you have end-to-end type safety.

## Auth

Auth was set up for [Lucia](https://lucia-auth.com/)
but has been changed to the guide at [Lucia-next](https://lucia-next.pages.dev/).
It's currently using username/password auth and storing to a session.
That information is available to astro as well as fastify and trpc.

## ORM

Data access is done using [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/), and the example is set up for an SQLite database.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:
