# Astro Fastify Starter

This is an example repo of having astro and fastify in the same app.
It's based off the fastify example in the 
[node adapter](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/node/#middleware) section.
The main difference is this uses typescript. It also has an example of using the 
[trpc fastify adapter,](https://trpc.io/docs/server/adapters/fastify) so you have end to end type safety.
